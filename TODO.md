## Instructions

Run the following experiments. For each experiment, run it, log the results in EXPERIMENTS.md. If an experiment is successful, apply it to the baseline, otherwise, discard any code changes that were made for it. An experiments is successful if:

1. It results in less trainable parameters per model while maintaining a >50% success rate of achieving >99% exact match.
2. It increases the success rate while maintaining the same amount of trainable parameters
3. It reduces the wall-clock time without impacting trainable parameters or success rate
