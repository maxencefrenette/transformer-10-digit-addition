# Agent Rules

## Experiment Naming
- Do not append `_mps` to experiment names.
- Assume experiments run on MPS by default in this repository unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Experiment Logging
- Always record every experiment result in `EXPERIMENTS.md`.
- Add the command, key outputs/paths, and findings after each run.
